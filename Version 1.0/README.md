# Platix Version 1.0

This is version 1.0 of Platix! 
To run the game, run Platix.exe and enjoy!

The controls are "a" and "d" to move left and right respectively, "esc" to pause, space for jump, and the mouse to click buttons.
Since this was made with Unity, those controls can of course be changed.

This version of Platix includes the following:

-A Main Menu with functioning Level Select and Quit buttons (the settings button exists but currently does nothing)
-4 Unique levels
-A timer and "best time" system
-Spikes on the grounds and walls, as well as attatched to floating flails that rotate
-A UI that displays the deaths on the current level, as well as the time that you have taken within the level
-A UI manager that makes sure the player only sees one screen at a time (screen include the GUI, death screen, win screen, and pause screen).
-Some hidden jump features

I speed ran all 4 levels with these best times. Can you beat them?

Level 1: 11.233 seconds
Level 2: 17.599 seconds
Level 3: 15.183 seconds
Level 4: 20.466 seconds

Can you complete the entire game in under 2 minutes?
