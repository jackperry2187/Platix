# Latest Platix Build

If this folder is downloaded and the .exe is ran, it gives you the latest completed build of the game!
Keep in mind this game is meant for a 64 bit version of Windows only. Other capabilities are possible in the future thanks to Unity possibly being able to build straight to other platforms. I haven't experimented here. At all.

Also, level 2 is not created at the moment, so the button doesn't work. Duh.
